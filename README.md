- The communication key for the scanner plugin is located in the scanner.json file on the web server or is displayed in the console upon startup. Without this key, the auto-scan cannot be started or stopped.
- The server connection is activated via the Connect button. A green status indicates a successful connection. The server information will now be forwarded to the TEF Logger app.
